I recently built a Data Professional Survey Dashboard in Power BI, converting raw survey data into interactive, decision-ready insights.

🔹 Efficiency improvements achieved:

⏱ Reduced manual analysis time by ~50%

📊 Automated key KPIs (Survey Count, Average Age, Happiness Scores)

⚡ Faster insight discovery using slicers and dynamic visuals

❌ Eliminated repetitive Excel calculations

🔹 Insights covered:

Country-wise & role-wise distribution

Salary vs work-life balance analysis

Difficulty of entering the data field

Programming language preferences

📈 Impact:
This dashboard enables stakeholders to understand trends in minutes instead of hours, improving reporting speed and clarity.
